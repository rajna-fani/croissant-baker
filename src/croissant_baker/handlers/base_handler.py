    """
    Abstract base class for file type handlers.

    Each handler is responsible for three things:
    - can_handle: decide if this handler owns a given file
    - extract_metadata: extract raw metadata from a single file
    - build_croissant: turn that metadata into Croissant FileSets + RecordSets

    All three are required. The generator owns FileObject creation and ID
    assignment; build_croissant returns only FileSets and RecordSets.

    Adding a new format: subclass this, implement all three methods,
    register the instance in registry.py — no other files need to change.
