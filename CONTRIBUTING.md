# Contributing to Croissant Baker

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Croissant Baker! This guide will help you get started.

## Ways to contribute

- **Report bugs** by opening a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/croissant-baker/issues).
- **Suggest features** or improvements via issues or discussions.
- **Submit pull requests** for bug fixes, new features, documentation, or new file handlers.
- **Improve documentation** in `docs/` or the README.

## Getting started

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for setup, testing, releases, and how to add new file handlers.

## Development workflow

1. Create a branch from `main` for your changes.
2. Make your changes, ensuring tests pass and pre-commit hooks are satisfied.
3. Commit with a message following the [commit conventions](DEVELOPMENT.md#commit-message-conventions).
4. Open a pull request against `main`.

## Testing guidelines

- Add tests for any new functionality or bug fixes.
- Place test data in `tests/data/input/` and expected output in `tests/data/output/`.
- Integration tests are in `tests/test_end_to_end.py`; unit tests are in handler-specific files (e.g. `tests/test_csv_handler.py`).
- CI runs the test suite on Python 3.10 and 3.12.

## Pull request process

1. Ensure all tests pass locally (`uv run pytest -v`).
2. Ensure pre-commit hooks pass (`uv run pre-commit run --all-files`).
3. Write a clear PR description explaining what changed and why.
4. CI will automatically run tests and pre-commit checks on your PR.
5. A maintainer will review your PR and may request changes.
